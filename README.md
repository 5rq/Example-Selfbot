### Example
This is just an example of how you would make a selfbot with discord.py-self and I don't plan to add anything to it.

## Discord.py-self
Discord.py-self is a fork of discord.py for selfbots! You can find more information about it [here](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self).

# WARNING
Discord selfbots are against [Discord's guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines), and I take no responsibility if you get your account terminated.
