# Example
This is just an example of how you would make a selfbot with discord.py-self and I don't plan to add anything to it.

### Discord.py-self
Discord.py-self is a fork of discord.py for selfbots! You can find more information about it [here](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self).

##### how to use?!
Make two "Secrets", one with the key "token" and one with the key "prefix", then make the value of "token" your Discord token and then make the value of "prefix" the prefix you want to use.

# WARNING
Discord selfbots are against [Discord's guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines), and I take no responsibility if you get your account terminated.
